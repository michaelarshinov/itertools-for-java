itertools-for-java
==================

Both Algorithms are searching for the combinations of n different digits
i.e. n=3
[0, 1, 2]
[0, 1, 3]
...
[0, 2, 9]
[0, 3, 1]
[0, 3, 2]
...
[9, 8, 6]
[9, 8, 7]
 
To compare Backtracking and Linear Algorithms you can run "ant test" in your console (on my machine it works a minute).
